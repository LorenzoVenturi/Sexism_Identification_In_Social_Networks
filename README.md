# Sexism_Identification_In_Social_Networks
We address [EXIST 2023 Task 2](https://clef2023.clef-initiative.eu/index.php?page=Pages/labs.html#EXIST) on sexism detection.
This task aims to categorize the sexist messages according to the intention of the author in one of the following categories: (i) direct sexist message, (ii) reported sexist message and (iii) judgemental message.

### Examples:

#### DIRECT 
The intention was to write a message that is sexist by itself or incites to be sexist, as in:

''*A woman needs love, to fill the fridge, if a man can give this to her in return for her services (housework, cooking, etc), I don’t see what else she needs.*''
